# Aura Localizer (CONCEPTUAL)
The app that lets you understand your apps with aura.

## What is it?
Chat, this app brings aura right to your desktop. Ever had that anime game with no translations at all? Ever had that one utility that looked like the English version was written by a 5-year-old? This app can install not just plain English packs, but many different English language packs into supporting apps. Our key feature is the ability to lowkey download what we call "slanguage packs", or more simply, "slangs". You can also load language packs made by others, which don't have to be in just English, either! No more wishing that you could use that new app you downloaded in Korean... because now, you can! We bring the aura of understand straight to your desktop.

### Our built-in language packs
We have a few different language packs, as well as a few (free) DLC packs.

#### Aura Lowkey
Aura Lowkey is our main attraction. Install Gen Alpha slang localization packs to any app that Aura supports installing to.

#### Aura Otaku
Don't worry, oniisan. Kimi wasarena-katta. Install weeb and otaku localization packs to most apps that Aura supports installing to.

#### Aura Simple
I hate big words too. Aura Simple lets you get packs with smaller words. Simple packs can work with some apps in Aura, but not all.

#### ReAura
> [!WARNING]
> If you choose to install in place of the original file, there is no way to get the original pack back except to re-install the app.

Don't let bad translations get in your way! ReAura packs can install *fixed English packs* either next to or in place of the original file.

## Our DLC Packs
### Aura Brainrot (DLC)
Aura Lowkey already allows you to view apps in Gen Alpha Slang. Aura Brainrot takes it to the next level and makes sure you have the skibidiest experience ever.

### Aura Rōmaji (DLC)
Using our DLC packs, on supported apps, get a romanization of the official Japanese translation! These are must-have packs for weebs!

## What about other packs?
If you know of a language pack provider that hosts an Aura Mirror version of their packs, you can instantly add it by going to "Tinker Around > Sources" and adding the URL to the JSON manifest.

Otherwise, download the language pack, and directly load it by clicking the dropdown next to "Install Aura Lowkey", and click "Disk Load."
